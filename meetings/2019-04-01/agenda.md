## SRC Financial Situation

In order to financially operate under SRC' name, to pay for some of the fixed
costs of running the organization, we need to:

* Open a company bank account,
* Sit down with our lawyer and have a discussion about bookkeeping.

Some of the things we need it for are:

* Email addresses (at least an info@src.technology)
* Sponsorships
* Meetups
* Research Material



## Sponsoring ReasonConf

ReasonConf is coming on soon, and a cooperation agreement with Reason
Association is required for a proper sponsorship of the event.

This will help us work towards our goals of support the OCaml/Reason ecosystem,
and as a by product give us some exposure. The cost of this sponsorship is
roughly 1,000 EUR.



## Travel Sponsorship for JSConf EU

As I mentioned before, when I was asked if my employer would pay for my
travelling by JSConf EU organizers, I said that it would pay for my flights.
This will put SRC as a Travel Sponsor on their website and help us publicize
some of the work we are doing.

We can have this discussion on the Board meeting for May.



## Brochure Website

Given the opportunities to increase the exposure of SRC, and the nature of
these venues implying some interesting pair of eyes being laid upon us, I'd like
to propose we spend some time setting up a website that conveys what we strive
for, what we are working on right now, and that provides ways for people to
submit donations.




## Github Learning Labs

Github has opened Learning Labs that we could use to document and guide some
of our learnings in the form of workshops. This could benefit the ReasonSTHLM
meetup and any other form of training that SRC provides.
