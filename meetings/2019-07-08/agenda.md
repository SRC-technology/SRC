## Notes per Topic


### 2.i) The Structure of SRC

At the moment SRC is composed by 6 members and its structure requires work on the following domains:

* _PR / Marketing / Community Management_, including managing twitter accounts, arranging meetings with
  other institutions, doing outreach to conferences and other events, managing a discord channel.

* _Finances_, including tracking expenses, coordinating bank appointments, and pursuing funds.

* _Legal_, including keeping up to date with regulations, and making sure that in each one of our
  engagements we do not lose our status as a non-profit, nor act illegally out of ignorance.

* _IT_, including managing Google Apps for business, our Github organization, a Domain, and other
  related internet infrastructure.

* _Administrative_, such as planning board meetings, keeping track of the minutes, collecting
  on-going project proposals, making sure they are all well written and up to date, reviewing
  new ones, et al. 
  
* _Education_, including planning and preparing educational material, giving lectures, and running
  meetups.

* _Software Research_, which includes the actual open source software we write, the experiments we
  conduct, and the research literature we publish.

As we grow, each one of these concerns will take more time, and we will have to balance them. Note
how only the last 2 are directly related to our _core activities_, and the rest are supporting activities.

I'd like everyone to be aware of this, so everyone can more clearly chime in on any of the areas that
you feel you can be helpful. Perhaps over time some people will organically lead some of the areas listed above.


### 2.ii) Readying the Finances of SRC

We have quickly moved through the first half of the year and we have had several movements, both
donated non-liquid assets (books, stickers, plane tickets, etc) and liquid assets (money on our
Patreon account or sitting in our bank).

I've kept track of these movements as closely as I could in [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CfhN6m8DcTirUi0-mq6Lvna3HDDPbNTxifJIj8M0L2g)
but as Malin Männikkö pointed out, there is a conflict of interests in place, and there's an obvious
risk of _ignorantia iuris nocet_.

Moreover, we need to lay out the procedures by which we will report our finances to the state,
including necessary formularies, accounting books, and any other paperwork that is required.

To ready SRC for financial operation, I move to:

* Outline the yearly process for reporting finances to the state
* Book a meeting with a service provider for bookkeeping, in particular Bokio, and make sure
  we understand the value they bring and what part of the process we need to fill in ourselves
* Appoint a _Treasurer_ for SRC, who will from then on be responsible for overseeing our finances.



### 2.ii) Guidelines for Spending and Expensing

It was brought up by Malin Männikkö that we should formalize how we spend SRCs resources.




### 2.iii) Ammendments to Membership Conditions, and introduction of a distinction between Supporters and Contributors

We have had discussions related to whether the Patreon status means you can be a Member of SRC.

Make no mistake, from our conception our Articles of Association describe a _Membership Fee_, much
like any other non-profit has one to be considered a member of it. Such _Membership Fee_ buys you
you certain privileges, all of them outlined in the Articles of Association.

In our case, we had agreed upon any Member over the age of 16 being able to vote at the AGM, every year.
This means that the Membership Fee bought you voting rights.

To further safeguard the future of SRC, we discussed the differences between a Supporter, who is
is in collaboraton with SRC via a conditionless donation, and a Contributor, who is contributes to SRC
with their own time and work.

I would like to reflect these changes in our Articles.
