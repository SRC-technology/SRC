1. Analytics?
2. Setup donations page?

## Research Proposals

I'd like us to spend an hour going through the projects that we currently 
have proposed to SRC, and either mark them as _deferred_, _ongoing_, 
or _paused_.

## Research Process

If we agree that a project is _ongoing_, then we must define what sort of 
commitment and investment will be made. This doesn't have to be a number
of hours a week that _must_ be dedicated to it, but it gives us a sense
of accountability towards each other.

In addition, this helps the outside world, including future donators and
contributors, understand what commitment we are putting into these projects,
and how much they can trust on us to get something done.


## Learning Labs

I'd like us to discuss the extent to which we could use learning labs as
a platform for most of our educational work.


## Mailing Lists

We've set up a mailing list already on Mailchimp. I'd like us to define
some use-cases for it.


## Patreon

Recently I've set up a Patreon page for SRC here: https://www.patreon.com/src_technology/overview

I'd like us to discuss briefly our supporter tiers and what kind of goals
we are looking to have.
