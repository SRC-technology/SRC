Deliverable(s): Abstract handed in

Title: The engineer in the room

Abstract: A new project is started up. Product managers and designers get together with the client to discuss the vision and purpose of the product. The only thing missing? The people who will implement the new product.

In this talk we will hear what having an engineer in the room can do for the quality of the end product, tight deadlines, and the happiness of the team. We'll walk through what we as developers can do to strengthen the relationship with product and design and how that can lead to better products for our users.
