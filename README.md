## Who we Are 

Stockholm Research Center (SRC for short, pronounced _source_) is a
non-for-profit organization based in Stockholm, Sweden, that is run in a
completely open manner.

SRC aims to __advance humanity__, specifically our interaction with technology,
our understanding of technology, and technology itself, via a series of
initiatives.

We value _transparency, curiosity, and audacity_.

SRC was founded as is currently operated by:
