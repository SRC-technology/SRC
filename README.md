## Who we Are 

Stockholm Research Center (SRC for short, pronounced _source_) is a
non-for-profit organization based in Stockholm, Sweden, that is run in a
completely open manner.

SRC aims to __advance humanity__, specifically our interaction with technology,
our understanding of technology, and technology itself, via a series of
initiatives.

We value _transparency, curiosity, and audacity_.

SRC was founded and is currently operated by:

## How we Work

redacted, will be made available publicly in this Git repository.

Here you will find:

1. [Meetings](meetings), with our detailed Agendas and Minutes.
2. Core documents, such as the [Articles of
   Association](core/articles-of-association), and current [Board
   Composition](core/board).
3. [Branding
   Documents](https://github.com/src-technology/org/tree/master/brand), such as
   our logotype in various formats.
