SRC is a non-for-profit organization based in Stockholm, Sweden, that is run in
a completely open manner.

SRC aims to __advance humanity__, specifically our interaction with technology,
our understanding of technology, and technology itself, via a series of
initiatives.

We value _transparency, curiosity, and audacity_.

This open methodology, inspired by one of our values, means that
all of our official documents, modulo some sensitive information
being redacted, will be made available publicly in this
Git repository.

Here you will find:

1. [Meetings](meetings), with our detailed Agendas and Minutes.
2. [Core documents](core), such as the [Articles of
Association](core/articles-of-association.md) , and current [Board
Composition](core/board.md).
3. [Branding documnts](brand), such as our logotype in various formats.
